# Managing Incidents

Incidents represent unplanned service disruptions or issues affecting your infrastructure.

## Creating an Incident

1. Go to **Status → Incidents**
2. Click **Create New**
3. Fill in the incident details:
   - **Title** - Brief description (e.g., "API Gateway Latency Issues")
   - **Affected Services** - Select impacted services
   - **Impact on affected services** - Status the affected services receive while the incident is open (Degraded Performance, Partial Outage or Major Outage). Once the incident is resolved, the services return to Operational, unless another open incident still affects them. Every status change is recorded in the status log.
   - **Status** - Current investigation status
4. Click **Save**

A notification draft is automatically created when you save.

## Incident Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Investigating** | Issue detected, investigating cause |
| **Identified** | Root cause identified, working on fix |
| **Monitoring** | Fix applied, monitoring for stability |
| **Resolved** | Issue fully resolved |

### Status Flow

```
Investigating → Identified → Monitoring → Resolved
```

You can skip statuses if appropriate (e.g., go directly to Resolved for quick fixes).

## Impact Levels

| Impact | Description | Display |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Operational | No user impact (informational) | 🟢 Green |
| Degraded Performance | Slower than normal | 🟡 Yellow |
| Partial Outage | Some functionality unavailable | 🟠 Orange |
| Major Outage | Service completely unavailable | 🔴 Red |

## Adding Updates

As the incident progresses, add updates to the timeline:

1. Open the incident
2. Scroll to **Updates**
3. Click **Add Update**
4. Fill in:
   - **Status** - Current status
   - **Message** - Update details
   - **Created At** - When this update occurred
5. Click **Save**

A new notification draft is automatically created for each update.

## Resolving an Incident

1. Open the incident
2. Change **Status** to "Resolved"
3. The **Resolved At** timestamp is automatically set
4. Click **Save**
5. Review and send the final notification

## Incident Permalinks

Each incident gets a unique short ID (e.g., `abc123`) that creates a permanent link:

```
https://status.example.com/i/abc123
```

This link is included in notifications and remains valid even if the title changes.

## Best Practices

### Titles

- Be specific but concise
- Include the affected component
- Avoid blame or technical jargon

Good: "Payment Processing Delays"
Bad: "Database server crashed due to OOM killer"

### Updates

- Post updates every 30-60 minutes during active incidents
- Be honest about what you know and don't know
- Set expectations for next update

### Resolution

- Confirm the issue is fully resolved before closing
- Include a brief summary of what happened
- Thank users for their patience
